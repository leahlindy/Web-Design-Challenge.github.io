Combined my existing skills with python (Pandas, Matplotlib, API) with web development to create a Mars weather site. 
The first stage was gathering data to fill the site.

- Mars InSight Mission API has weather data. 
- Used the pandas and matplotlib libraries to make fun little weather graphs to display with tabs on the website
- Mars Images API has raw images from each of the 3 rovers on mars for each sol. Once the images for given camera and sol were retreived they were saved into a dictionary.

HTML
- Bootstrap front-end library used for CSS library to develop an asthetically pleasing site
- Bootswatch Lux theme also imported for colours and formatting library

Tools used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (API, Matplot, Pandas)
